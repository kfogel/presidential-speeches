President: George W. Bush

      <p>Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tempore, members of Congress, and fellow Americans:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to report on the state of the Union.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, no such report is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has already been delivered by the American people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;We have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground -- passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer.&nbsp;&nbsp;And would you please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers, working past exhaustion.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers -- in English, Hebrew, and Arabic.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own.</p>

<p>My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of our Union -- and it is strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of America was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats joined together on the steps of this Capitol, singing "God Bless America."&nbsp;&nbsp;And you did more than sing; you acted, by delivering $40 billion to rebuild our communities and meet the needs of our military.</p>

<p>Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle and Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship, for your leadership and for your service to our country.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its outpouring of support.&nbsp;&nbsp;America will never forget the sounds of our National Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, on the streets of Paris, and at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul, or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America.

<p>Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own:&nbsp;&nbsp;dozens of Pakistanis; more than 130 Israelis; more than 250 citizens of India; men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico and Japan; and hundreds of British citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;America has no truer friend than Great Britain.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, we are joined together in a great cause -- so honored the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity of purpose with America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for coming, friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>On September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans have known wars -- but for the past 136 years, they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941.&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans have known the casualties of war -- but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans have known surprise attacks -- but never before on thousands of civilians.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this was brought upon us in a single day -- and night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack.</p>

<p>Americans have many questions tonight.&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans are asking:&nbsp;&nbsp;Who attacked our country?&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the same murderers indicted for bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for bombing the USS Cole.</p>

<p>Al Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;But its goal is not making money; its goal is remaking the world -- and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere.</p>

<p>The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics -- a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam.&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinction among military and civilians, including women and children.</p>

<p>This group and its leader -- a person named Osama bin Laden -- are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction.</p>

<p>The leadership of al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Afghanistan, we see al Qaeda's vision for the world.</p>

<p>Afghanistan's people have been brutalized -- many are starving and many have fled.&nbsp;&nbsp;Women are not allowed to attend school.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can be jailed for owning a television.&nbsp;&nbsp;Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate.&nbsp;&nbsp;A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The United States respects the people of Afghanistan -- after all, we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid -- but we condemn the Taliban regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not only repressing its own people, it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists.&nbsp;&nbsp;By aiding and abetting murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And tonight, the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban:&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your land. (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Release all foreign nationals, including American citizens, you have unjustly imprisoned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Protect foreign journalists, diplomats and aid workers in your country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their support structure, to appropriate authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. &nbsp;(Applause.) &nbsp;The Taliban must act, and act immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp;They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;We respect your faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's practiced freely by many millions of Americans, and by millions more in countries that America counts as friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every government that supports them.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>Americans are asking, why do they hate us?&nbsp;&nbsp;They hate what we see right here in this chamber -- a democratically elected government.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their leaders are self-appointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;They hate our freedoms -- our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other.</p>

<p>They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan.&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East.&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;With every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from the world and forsaking our friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;They stand against us, because we stand in their way.</p>

<p>We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen their kind before.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century.&nbsp;&nbsp;By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions -- by abandoning every value except the will to power -- they follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism.&nbsp;&nbsp;And they will follow that path all the way, to where it ends:&nbsp;&nbsp;in history's unmarked grave of discarded lies. (Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Americans are asking:&nbsp;&nbsp;How will we fight and win this war?&nbsp;&nbsp; We will direct every resource at our command -- every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of war -- to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.</p>

<p>This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not look like the air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground troops were used and not a single American was lost in combat.</p>

<p>Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.</p>

<p>Our nation has been put on notice:&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not immune from attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, dozens of federal departments and agencies, as well as state and local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security.&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level.&nbsp;&nbsp;So tonight I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to me -- the Office of Homeland Security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort, to strengthen American security: a military veteran, an effective governor, a true patriot, a trusted friend -- Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;He will lead, oversee and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism, and respond to any attacks that may come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These measures are essential.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty.&nbsp;&nbsp;All deserve our thanks, and all have our prayers.&nbsp;&nbsp;And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a message for our military:&nbsp;&nbsp;Be ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've called the Armed Forces to alert, and there is a reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;The hour is coming when America will act, and you will make us proud.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>This is not, however, just America's fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is at stake is not just America's freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the world's fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is civilization's fight.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom.</p>

<p>We ask every nation to join us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will ask, and we will need, the help of police forces, intelligence services, and banking systems around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States is grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded -- with sympathy and with support.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nations from Latin America, to Asia, to Africa, to Europe, to the Islamic world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best the attitude of the world:&nbsp;&nbsp;An attack on one is an attack on all.</p>

<p>The civilized world is rallying to America's side.&nbsp;&nbsp;They understand that if this terror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next.&nbsp;&nbsp;Terror, unanswered, can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you know what -- we're not going to allow it.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>Americans are asking:&nbsp;&nbsp;What is expected of us?&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask you to live your lives, and hug your children.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know many citizens have fears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat.</p>

<p>I ask you to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many have come here.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by them.&nbsp;&nbsp;No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who want to give can go to a central source of information, libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.</p>

<p>The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it.</p>

<p>I ask for your patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security; and for your patience in what will be a long struggle.</p>

<p>I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity.&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not touch its source.&nbsp;&nbsp;America is successful because of the hard work, and creativity, and enterprise of our people.&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the true strengths of our economy before September 11th, and they are our strengths today. (Applause.)</p>

<p>And, finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families, for those in uniform, and for our great country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prayer has comforted us in sorrow, and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead.</p>

<p>Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will do.&nbsp;&nbsp;And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their representatives, for what you have already done and for what we will do together.</p>

<p>Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will come together to improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights, and take new measures to prevent hijacking.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying, with direct assistance during this emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act, and find them before they strike.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America's economy, and put our people back to work.</p>

<p>Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorkers:&nbsp;&nbsp;Governor George Pataki, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)&nbsp;&nbsp;As a symbol of America's resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>After all that has just passed -- all the lives taken, and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them -- it is natural to wonder if America's future is one of fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some speak of an age of terror.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there are struggles ahead, and dangers to face.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this country will define our times, not be defined by them.&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror; this will be an age of liberty, here and across the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>Great harm has been done to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have suffered great loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;And in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom and fear are at war.&nbsp;&nbsp;The advance of human freedom -- the great achievement of our time, and the great hope of every time -- now depends on us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our nation -- this generation -- will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is good.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even grief recedes with time and grace.&nbsp;&nbsp;But our resolve must not pass.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of us will remember what happened that day, and to whom it happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll remember the moment the news came -- where we were and what we were doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will remember an image of a fire, or a story of rescue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever.</p>

<p>And I will carry this:&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not yield; I will not rest; I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people.</p>

<p>The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is not neutral between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>

<p>Fellow citizens, we'll meet violence with patient justice -- assured of the rightness of our cause, and confident of the victories to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all that lies before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of America.</p>

<p>Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Applause.)</p>
